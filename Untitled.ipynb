2 win at hannover the key question remains about the man who has come to personify borussia dortmund , jurgen klopp\\\\nlike sir alex ferguson at manchester united and arsene wenger at arsenal , jurgen klopp \"s personality , tactics and energy seem to embody every area of the club\\\\nunderstandably jurgen klopp is always considered when top jobs come up\\\\nhe was on the shortlist to replace roberto mancini at manchester city but did not impress in interview - the passion that drives his teams sits uncomfortably with the increasingly corporate world of football executives\\\\nit looks as though those pushing for him as a natural replacement for arsene wenger at arsenal overplayed their hand somewhat\\\\nthe intensity of the rivalry with bayern munich means he is highly unlikely to end up there when pep guardiola ends his time in 2016\\\\nstriker pierre-emerick aubameyang poses for a photo with borussia dortmund fans after saturday \"s win former manchester united man shinji kagawa celebrates with reus after scoring at hannover and there is a feeling that many teams are now adept at dealing with the frenzied counter-attacking style and that he needs to add nuance to the tactics that so recently shocked europe \"s best sides\\\\nfor now it looks as if jurgen klopp and borussia dortmund \"s fates are bound together\\\\nat times , the rollercoaster season has seemed a projection on the ups and downs of jurgen klopp \"s own volatile personality\\\\nyet it \"s not so long ago he was a genuine wunderkind of european football\\\\nif he can emerge refreshed and re-energised from this season \"s chaos , there seems no reason why borussia dortmund should n\"t rise again in europe\\\\nthe next few weeks should tell us much\\\\nif borussia dortmund do make the europa league , then you might conclude that the rebuilding process is already underway .\"}\\n',\n",
